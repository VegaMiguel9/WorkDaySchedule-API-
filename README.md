### Third Party API Work Day Scheduler 

## Description 

# In this assignment I was tasked on making a scheduler list that uses HTML CSS with Jquerys and Javascript. I used a basic layout for html and css but also added moments.js to add the time. In the Javascript I had to make sure my content was being saved to the local storage and if the page was refreshed then the content would still be saved.

## How to use

# When the webpage is pulled up you can just in the type boxes and click the save button to save the text.
